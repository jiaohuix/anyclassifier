# Synthetic Data Generation For Text Classification
## Motivation
Synthetic data becomes more and more common because it can minimize data drift between training data and production data. 
It is also common for pretraining LLM in order to boost LLM performance.
It is required because some training data is very difficult or costly to collect from web/ other sources without handcraft.
In this article, we present an approach for text classification.

## Design
We adopt a hierarchical generation approach by asking LLM to suggest topic to expand on a particular label on first level, 
and suggest subtopic on second level,
It is also inspired by [1], where multiple personas are simulated to cover diverse scenario. We adopted source-type-driven 
strategy instead of persona-driven strategy as source type usually reflects a different groups of target audiences, and it is less fine-grained, 
which is more suitable for text classification model which is less data hungry in training.  
Each data synthesis is grounded on unique combination of (instruction, label, subtopic, source_type).
By enumerating on all these combination, it ensures the diversity of synthetic data by design.

## Prompt
### Prompt to Expand Source Type
```txt
I am building a document classifier to {{instruction}} with labels {{labels}}. Suggest {{n}} source type of information for efficient data acquisition.
Output JSON array. Each item contains key "source_type".
```
### Prompt to Expand Topic from Label
```txt
I am building a document classifier to {{instruction}} with labels {{labels}}. I would like to collect collectively exhaustive taxonomy or topic for the label: {{label}} from {{source_type}}.

<instruction>
- Suggest {{n}} taxonomies or topics to further expand on this label.
- Output JSON array. Each item contains key "item" 
</instruction>```

### Prompt to Expand Subtopic from Topic
```txt
I am building document classifier to {{instruction}} with labels {{labels}}.  I would like to collect collectively exhaustive subtopic under {{topic}} from {{source_type}}.

<instruction>
- Suggest {{n}} subtopic or keywords. 
- Output JSON array. Each item contains key "item" 
</instruction>
```

### Prompt to Generate 
```txt

Has anyone else seen this coming?"</li><li>"Bloomberg: Tesla's Earnings Miss Estimates as Revenue Declines 20% - The electric vehicle maker's quarterly earnings fell short of analysts' expectations, with revenue plummeting 20% to $24.58 billion. The company's gross margin also declined, sparking concerns about its ability to maintain profitability. Tesla's stock price tumbled 8% in after-hours trading, as investors reacted to the disappointing results. The miss is a setback for CEO Elon Musk, who has been under pressure to deliver consistent growth. Analysts had expected Tesla to report earnings of $0.55 per share, but the company came in at $0.35 per share. The revenue decline was driven by a 15% drop in automotive sales, as well as a 10% decline in energy generation and storage sales. The company's guidance for the current quarter also fell short of expectations, with Tesla forecasting revenue of $24 billion, below the consensus estimate of $25.5 billion. The earnings miss is a reminder that the electric vehicle market remains highly competitive, and that Tesla faces significant challenges in maintaining its market share."</li><li>"I'm getting out of the market before it's too late.

In this paper, we investigate the computational complexity of computing Gröbner bases for toric ideals, which are a key tool in the study of toric varieties. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for computing Gröbner bases for toric ideals in the case where the toric ideal is generated by a set of binomials.\n\nBackground\n\nA toric ideal is a polynomial ideal that is generated by a set of binomials. The Gröbner basis of a toric ideal is a set of binomials that generate the ideal and have a certain property called the S-polynomial property. The S-polynomial property is a key tool in the study of toric varieties, and has been used to solve a number of problems in computational algebra.\n\nMain Result\n\nOur main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for computing Gröbner bases for toric ideals in the case where the toric ideal is generated by a set of binomials. The algorithm works by first computing the Hilbert series of the toric ideal, and then using this information to compute the Gröbner basis. We show that this algorithm can be used to solve a number of problems in computational algebra, including the computation of the Hilbert series of a toric ideal and the determination of the dimension of a toric variety.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we have investigated the computational complexity of computing Gröbner bases for toric ideals.

We believe that this result has implications for the study of toric varieties and their applications in computer science and engineering.'</li><li>"A novel approach to designing efficient hash tables for large-scale data storage is proposed in this paper. The proposed hash table, dubbed 'Efficient Hash Table' (EHT), employs a combination of open addressing and linear probing to minimize collisions and improve search times. Experimental results demonstrate that EHT outperforms existing hash table implementations in terms of search time and memory usage, making it an attractive solution for big data applications. The EHT algorithm is implemented using a C++ programming language and is shown to scale well on multi-core processors. This paper contributes to the field of data structures by providing a new, efficient, and scalable hash table design that can be used in a variety of applications, including databases, file systems, and cloud storage systems."</li><li>"Abstract: This paper presents an efficient array-based algorithm for searching and sorting large datasets. The proposed algorithm utilizes a combination of bit-packing and prefix sums to achieve a time complexity of O(n) for search operations and O(n log n) for sort operations.

The proposed scheme utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to enable secure key exchange between two parties. The scheme is based on the BB84 protocol, which is a widely used QKD protocol. However, the proposed scheme introduces a new feature, known as the "quantum error correction" mechanism, which enables the detection of any eavesdropping attempts. The proposed scheme is analyzed using the security analysis framework, which shows that it is secure against any eavesdropping attempts. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using simulations, which show that it outperforms existing QKD schemes in terms of key generation rate and security.

Introduction\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed the way we live and work, connecting billions of devices worldwide. However, the increased connectivity also raises significant security concerns, as IoT devices are often vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure communication framework for IoT devices using quantum key distribution (QKD) and homomorphic encryption.\n\nII. Background\n\nQuantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a method of secure key exchange that relies on the principles of quantum mechanics. QKD enables two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel, without revealing the key to any third party. Homomorphic encryption, on the other hand, is a type of encryption that enables computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first.\n\nIII. Proposed Framework\n\nOur proposed framework consists of two main components: QKD-based key exchange and homomorphic encryption-based data processing. The QKD component uses the BB84 protocol to establish a secure key exchange between IoT devices, while the homomorphic encryption component uses the HElib library to perform secure data processing.\n\nIV. Simulation and Experiment Results\n\nWe conducted simulations and experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework. The results show that our framework provides robust security against various types of attacks, including eavesdropping and tampering attacks. We also demonstrate the ability of our framework to provide secure data processing without revealing sensitive information.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we proposed a secure communication framework for IoT devices using QKD and homomorphic encryption. Our framework provides robust security against various types of attacks and enables secure data processing without revealing sensitive information.

It provides a framework for understanding the symmetries of algebraic varieties and has applications in various areas of mathematics, including commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and representation theory. In this paper, we apply GIT to study the invariant theory of a certain algebraic group action on a projective variety. We use the Hilbert-Mumford criterion to determine the semistable points of the action and then compute the invariant ring using the Grothendieck ring of the group.

Our approach is based on the idea of representing a group as a quotient of a reductive group by a finite subgroup. We show that this construction yields a faithful representation of the group, and we use it to compute the character table of the symmetric group S_5. Our method has several advantages over existing methods, including the ability to handle large groups and the flexibility to incorporate additional structure. We also discuss some potential applications of our method, including the computation of representation theory for finite groups of Lie type.\n\nKeywords: representation theory, algebraic geometry, finite groups, reductive groups, symmetric group\n\nArXiv ID: 2203.10201\n\nSubmission date: 2022-03-17'</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The Neron-Severi lattice $NS(S)$ is the subgroup of $Pic(S)$ generated by the divisor classes of the curve $S$. Our main goal is to classify the K3 surfaces $S$ such that $NS(S)$ is isomorphic to a lattice of the form $U \times E_8$, where $U$ is a hyperbolic plane and $E_8$ is the standard $E_8$ lattice. We achieve this by first showing that such a surface must have a certain type of singular point, and then using this information to compute the invariants of $NS(S)$. Our classification result has implications for the study of arithmetic geometry, and provides a new perspective on the geometry of K3 surfaces.'</li><li>'arXiv:2203.01023v1 [math.RT] 1 Mar 2022\n\nTitle: On the representation theory of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of the symmetric group\n\nAbstract: We study the representation theory of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of the symmetric group.

We propose a novel method for solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation, which is a fundamental equation in optimal control theory. Our approach is based on a combination of deep learning and numerical methods, and it is capable of handling high-dimensional systems with nonlinear dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical experiments on several benchmark problems, including a nonlinear pendulum and a nonlinear cart-pole system. Our results show that our method can achieve better performance than existing methods, and it is computationally efficient.

The proposed approach is demonstrated on a benchmark problem, which is a two-input two-output system with uncertainties in the plant and disturbances in the input.\n\nResults\n\nThe proposed approach is compared with existing methods, including H-infinity control and mu-synthesis.

However, in high-dimensional systems, the computational cost of learning Bayesian networks can be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to Bayesian network learning using Gaussian process priors. Our approach, which we call Bayesian network learning with Gaussian process priors (BN-GP), leverages the flexibility of Gaussian processes to model the uncertainty in the network structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BN-GP on several high-dimensional systems, including a synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset from the field of systems biology. Our results show that BN-GP can learn accurate Bayesian networks with significantly reduced computational cost compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of BN-GP, which shows that it can learn consistent estimates of the network structure even in the presence of high-dimensional data. Our approach has the potential to enable the widespread adoption of Bayesian networks in high-dimensional systems, where traditional methods are often infeasible.\n\nKeywords: Bayesian networks, Gaussian process priors, uncertainty quantification, high-dimensional systems, systems biology.'</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Usage
You can either specify `n_record_to_generate` or all of the params `n_source_type`, `n_topic`, `n_subtopic`, `sample_per_subtopic`.
If first is used, our implementation aims at generate such no of record, but it might not be exact because of unpredictability of LLM.
If later is used, the result no of record = no of label * n_source_type * n_topic * n_subtopic * sample_per_subtopic. It may be required for some problems, for example, where you see more source_type and less in topic.
If there are many labels in a classification problem, it might take a while to generate synthetic data.

## Benchmarking
We tested on three datasets - imdb, zeroshot/twitter-financial-news-sentiment and ccdv/arxiv-classification. 
Model performance of synthetic data is at par with/ close to that of real data, which is not bad because the testing data is usually morel similar to training (real) data than synthetic data.  
It implies the synthetic data generated is close to the distribution of test data, showing the effectiveness of this synthetic data generation approach.
We will continue to add more benchmark on other datasets.

Codes to replicate is stored in [examples](../examples).
