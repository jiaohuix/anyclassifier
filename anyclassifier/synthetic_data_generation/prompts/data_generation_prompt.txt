I am building document classifier to {instruction} with labels {labels}. I would like to collect samples for the label: {label}.

<instruction>
- Generate realistic examples for a classification model that will predict label {{label}}.
- Characteristics:
  Topic: {topic}.
  Source type: {source_type}
- Generate {n} example.
- The example shall have a realistic length, and cannot be too short.
- Output JSON array. Each item contains key "text" 
</instruction>
