I am building a document classifier to {instruction} with labels {labels}. I would like to collect collectively exhaustive taxonomy or topic for the label: {label} from {source_type}.

<instruction>
- Suggest {n} taxonomies or topics to further expand on this label.
- Output JSON array. Each item contains key "item" 
</instruction>
